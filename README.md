The Spaceship Game
========================


This project was one of my first programming project which was a simple 2D spaceship game made with Turing (the language that is Pascal related). This game required simple programming concepts such as variable declaration, for loops, while loops, handling variables, conditional statements, UI implementation, methods etc. 

###Requirements To Run###
You must first download Turing 4.1.1
Then You must put all pictures and the spaceship.t file in the same location
Then you must run spaceship.t file, and see the game running.
