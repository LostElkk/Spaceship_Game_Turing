##Spaceship Game##
####About this game####
I first made this game when I was in grade 10 at the age of 14. It features basic programming concepts such as loops, variables, procedures, coordinate system etc. Basically, in this game you have to control a spacehip and avoid rocks and obstacle, or simple shoot fireball to kill obstacles. Instructions may be found inside the game itself. 

####Turing####
This game is made on the Turing platform. Turing is a language that was created for learning purposes. It is commonly compared with Visual Basic. Turing is very similar to Pascal, but is made much easier to learn at first.
